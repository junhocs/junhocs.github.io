## The Patterns Will Show You the Solutions!

As a student in computer science, it is really common for us to see repetitive problems with similar solutions. whether it is a problem of having to sort hundreds of peoples names in a contact database, or sorting personal data in a consulting company, we can use some sort of design pattern to apply to our problem in coding. We can see many examples of instances when we take a look at different algorithms. for example, we can take a look at a simple algorithm "Quicksort" as our pattern. If we are presented with a problem of having to sort a big set of data, however we are given a handicap in a way that the device limited in memory. We can recognize the pattern and compare it to our "Quicksort" algorithm and solve our problem.

Design patterns provide us with a template of a solution that we can use repeatedly to a problem we can encounter in the programming world. They can even be some simple stuff like database structures to more complex things like algorithms similar to what we have seen above. They give us tools to solve our day to day problems without reinventing the wheel everytime.

## Is it Cheating or Best Practice?

In many programming classes students are told to not cheat/copy code to accomplish a certain task. However, when given a problem there is usually a template of a similar algorithm that can solve the given problem that can be our design pattern. For example, when I was taking entry level coding classes we are tasked to create some form of algorithms like Insertion sort, Bubble sort, and Merge sort for our assignments. What many students end up doing is looking up an existing algorithm on places like Chegg or Stack Overflow. However, if basing your assignments on these design patterns is best practice should it really count as cheating?
