## Raw HTML and CSS

Front end development, we all come across it. Weather its to browsing a news article or scrolling through someones social media feed. All these websites are put together using HTML and CSS. However, just using HTML and CSS to concatenate can be difficult. Several hours of hard work and debugging can still lead you to a website that looks like a toddlers drawing. So my question now is how can I work smarter to make it look better?

## Semantic UI and Other CSS Frameworks

There are many different CSS frameworks you could choose from. To list a few there are Bootstrap, Foundation, Susy, and UIkit. But all of these frameworks exist to make life easier for whoever is designing a website. Let us say you wanted to make a menubar that looked pleasing to the eye you would have to spend a lot more time trying to code every little thing when for example if you use Semantic UI you could just do something like "<div class="ui menu">" then have elements inside that menu. Not only that you can do things like add "left" or "right" and customize the attribute of the menu created with ease.

## The Verdict

Moving on to my verdict about this topic. trying to make a website solely with HTML and CSS is not going to be pretty for most cases, compared to using a CSS framework it will be inefficient and time-consuming. Now I am not saying that HTML and CSS are not important, but it is important to make use of these frameworks that are out there to the fullest in tandem with HTML and CSS.
