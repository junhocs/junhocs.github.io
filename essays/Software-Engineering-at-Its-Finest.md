## Software Engineering? What is that?

From grinding endless hours on Leetcode to working on webapps for deployment what are the boundaries of software engineering? In my software engineering class we went over the basics of deploying a webapp with some practical functionality. Due to this, it is easy for many of the people in the class to think that software engineering has to do with creating webapps. While this is somewhat true, real 'software engineering' does not have limits as to what it can be applied to.

## Design Patterns

During the timeframe of the software engineering course, if there were few things that were helpful on help my growth it would have to be the different design patterns of software engineering. While design patterns are found in software engineering, you can apply the concept of design patterns to any real life problem you encounter. From giving a business presentation to even every day cooking, design patterns make us realize and help us understand and use the tools to solve our everyday problems.

## Coding Standards

Another aspect of software engineering that I would say are import would be adhering to said coding standards. Not just in school, in the future most of us as software engineers will have to collaborate with others to solve our problem. In these instances of collaboration, I believe it is important to comment code as you go and adhere to said coding standards so others will be able to understand your code. It not only helps for your code to be coherent, if we do not have standards to things like coding reading a code in one language may sound like another due to formatting issues.

## A Perfect Software Engineer?

At the end of the day am I a perfect software engineer? No, far from it actually. I believe no one person in the world is a 'perfect' software engineer, we all have room for growth, and the market for software engineering is always growing and nearly infinite. With that being said although the so called software engineering class is over as of this semester, I will always strive to be a better software engineer improving my self and my skills as I go.
