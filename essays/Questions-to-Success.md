## Questions to Success
 
It is a proven fact that asking questions will improve our learning. Not only will it answer the unknown for the one asking it, it can be a learning opportunity for the one answering the question as well. I believe that asking a lot of questions is a faster way to learn than trying to figure it out yourself. Of course, you can learn by yourself, however your learning can be accelerated exponentially with the input of people that have more prior knowledge than you do. I do not believe there are “dumb” questions, questions exist because the asker is currently not knowledgeable in that subject of asking however we can see that there is a “smarter” way of asking questions.

## Learning to Ask "Smarter Questions"
[Example 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java).

In this question, the person asking the question stresses the fact that they have been using the “==” operator in his program. In addition to this he stated an example of how changing the “==” to “.equals()” solved their problem. Then they follow this up by asking specifics like “Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What’s the difference?” You can tell that this was a smart question because they are asking the specifics instead of just asking “what is the difference?”. By asking the specifics of its use case the people answering are able to give examples on when exactly its use can be efficient. For example the person who answers this question has a detailed example code specifying how they are different and test scenarios when they work and when they do not.

[Example 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname).

In this question the developer is asking about declaring functions in Javascript. They then go on to list examples of what was inside their code that they have to maintain.  Lastly the developer asks “what are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can’t be done with the other?” Similar to the previous example the developer states examples and asks specifics like asking for the pros and cons and what can be done with one that the other cannot. Due to the format of this question the person answering it continues on to tell them the difference between the two functions and continues to provide multiple examples with executable code snippets to add on.

## Questions That Can Go Deeper for Knowledge

[Example 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63828442/throw-an-error-message-using-ajax-when-user-fills-checkout-form).

This is an example of a not smart question. First of all, starting from the title the developer is just stating “Throw an error message using Ajax when user fills checkout form.” This is a statement not a question. In addition to this, the developer states what they are trying to do, which is good however the question post on stack overflow has zero images or code on what they are looking at or what they are trying to do. A way to improve this post would be to add an image of what they have and adding a question like “what would I need to do to make the error message display when the user fills the checkout form?”

[Example 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45556794/linear-search-code-in-python).

This is also another example of a not smart question. Just to start like the previous question the title of this post is a statement saying, “Linear search code in python.” In the actual question the developer asks, “This is a linear search code but it is not working can anyone help me?” First of all, I believe this is not necessarily a question but a demand for someone to give them they answer. If the developer wanted to ask a proper question about how this code does not work, they would have added things like what they have done so far to try and resolve the issue, and instead of asking “can anyone help me?” with the full code attached, they would pinpoint where the code went wrong and ask for a way to the answer not where the answer is. 

## My Learnings

The difference between smart questions and not smart questions are significant. When I was going through some of the questions in stackoverflow, the amount of knowledge that I get from a question that is well formulated and structured, and the ones that are not can be really big. The smart questions usually explain what they did first, show an example(s) of what they did and ask well-structured questions using simple key words that are easy to understand. We can all learn a thing or two about asking smarter questions, this way in the future we can help each other answer other people with smart questions in need.
