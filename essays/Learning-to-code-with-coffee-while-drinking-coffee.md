## Grinding Through the Night

  Many people say that staying up late at night to do your schoolwork is not efficent. However, it is around 1A.M. to 4A.M. where I shine best. I do not think you can grow as a learner if you dont grind through the night trying to learn what you are passionate about. If you are really passionate about something you would not do "just the bare minimum" to get the grade for the class. We as the people always go out to seek learn new knowledge, so why do some people just go through the motions and go about their day? To improve one self there are many ways one can go about doing that, for the that would be trying my so called "best" in this class.

## Learning About the Coffee

  For the first week of this class I was assigned modules from Freecodecamp to learn the basics of Javascript and ES6 for this class. I tend to have a habbit of working on multiple assignments at once due to my short attention span, and because of that I tend to start on assignments relativly early in the night, but go until 4A.M. in the morning. After two different assignments and a cup of coffee later I really started to get into the Javascript modules. I learned Java in my ICS 111 class, and Javascript having Java in the name was very similar to Java, but much easier in my opinion.

  ## Rinse and Repeat
 
  It's really easy for someone to learn something one day, but later on without any review just flat out forget everything that they have learned. I agree with the popular opinion of people saying that coding is like playing a musical instrument. Without practice and review one is able to just flat out forget how to format/ use the syntax of given coding language. However, with the practice WODs assigned to us so far I am finding coding practice really enjoyable, and it is making me excited for what is to come from the ICS 314 class in the future.
