## Grinding Through the Night

  Many people say that staying up late at night to do your schoolwork is not efficent. However, it is around 1A.M. to 4A.M. where I shine best. I do not think you can grow as a learner if you dont grind through the night trying to learn what you are passionate about. If you are really passionate about something you would not do "just the bare minimum" to get the grade for the class. We as the people always go out to seek learn new knowledge, so why do some people just go through the motions and go about their day? To improve one self there are many ways one can go about doing that, for the that would be trying my so called "best" in this class.
