## The Necessity of Formatting

When we learn a new language, one of the first things you learn are getting the grammer and the sentence structure. When these structures are incorrect when formulating a sentence what you are trying to say can be hard to understand or even worse incohearent. After being introduced to the basics of Javascript, I was introduced to the "Coding Standards" and ESlint of IntelliJ, which is a way of formatting my code "correctly." On one side of the story the coding standards could be helpful in a way that you can help other people understand your code better. Howevever, are these coding standards really necessary? 

## Is It Really Better?

From my experience, everyone has a different style of implementing working code. Before moving to IntelliJ IDEA, I was using JSFiddle for all my Javascript practicing needs. JSFiddle not having a code quality filter like IntelliJ I was able to format my code in any way I want, however I want. First week on my transition to IntelliJ IDEA, I found that the code correctional tool "ESlint" really likes to nidpick on code formatting. Anything from making you use const instead of let inside functions, and needing a space before you start your commenting, it can be quite tedious to meet all of these standards. I can understand that it helps with formatting, however, like I stated earlier everyone has their own consistant coding style.

## Its All About Consistency

Now the question we ask is, "is that green checkmark on the top right a benefit or a burden?"
