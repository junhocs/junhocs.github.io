  This project is called the Painting tool, this was my first ever program on Java. I created this program with very little knowledge of coding, however I was able to make this paint style program using the EZJava library.
  
  For this program the user can choose one of two images to spray on the brick wall in the background. The spray can is controlled by the mouse and the user can use the left click button to insert the image onto the brick wall. The main point of this project was to make use of EZJava being able to track the location of your mouse cursor.
